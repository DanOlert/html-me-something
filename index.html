                <h3>Piano</h3>
                <p>Its got a large range. Notes are percusive and result from the striking of a 
                    string. With the pedal held down, played notes resonate with the entire piano,
                    creating a watery lush tone. Its pretty versatile like its been used in many many
                 styles of music. Jazz piano is one of my favorite types, and romantic era classical piano.
                Piano is also popular for children to learn an instrument. This could be my favorite instrument. 
                Someday I hope to afford a nice grand piano.</p>

                    <h3>Violin</h3>
                    <p>I suppose classical music comes to mind with the violin. I think that the fiddle (basically the same thing as a violin, just played
                        with a different style) is really neat too. The body of the violin vibrates with the
                        string, amplifying the note being played. Its use in folk music is pretty cool. I bet its hard 
                        to memorize exactly where to put your fingers. There's no frets so this could be hard. The sound is a little
                        stringy, thats good or bad depending on the sound you want. 
                    </p>

                        <h3>Trumpet</h3>
                        <p> I innitially had mixed feelings about this one. I played the trumpet in band (chose it over violin),
                            I was pretty decent. It felt like a showy insrtument, like it was so loud. I didn't like being that loud at
                            first; its hard to practice when you're so noisy. Its got a good sound though, its very rich and warm. Its a vibrating column of air that makes
                            noise in this case. Pitch goes up and down by switching harmonics or by changing the lenght of the 
                            column of air with the buttons. I think trumpet sounds good in modern music, even rock and things like that.
